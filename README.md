# Conway's Game of Life

This is a rendition of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) built on the web platform. It is written in ES6, uses the Canvas API for rendering the grid, and vanilla DOM manipulation (with helper functions) for the rest. The only dependency is lodash, for convenience.
